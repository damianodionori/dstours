                            Born in beautiful Tuscany, Damiano brings authentic Italian passion to London's cultural scene. 
                            A graduate in Languages and Modern Cultures from Università della Tuscia, he's fluent in Italian 
                            and English, with conversational French and German. When he's not sharing fascinating historical 
                            insights at the Natural History Museum (his favorite spot), you might find him enjoying pizza, 
                            hiking, or cheering at motorsport events. His love for travel and animals makes his tours 
                            particularly engaging for visitors of all ages.

                        <p class="guide-bio">
                            Hailing from Veneto, Stefania earned her Master's Degree in Arts from the prestigious Università 
                            Ca' Foscari in Venice. Fluent in Italian and English with some Spanish, she brings artistic 
                            flair to every tour. The National Gallery is her second home, though she knows all of London's 
                            cultural gems intimately. When not guiding, this pasta-loving, music-enthusiast can be found 
                            riding her motorbike or walking her dogs. Her vibrant personality and deep knowledge make every 
                            tour a memorable experience.
